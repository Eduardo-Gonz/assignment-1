    <h2>Assignment 1</h2>
    <p>
      Publishing the work was the biggest challenge I faced while working on this assignment but I was able to accomplish the task by going through the resources provided in the assigmnent instructions. I didn't have trouble with the actual assignment because I've worked with HTML in the past. The most helpful resource was Campuswire because it allowed me to post questions anonymously and receive answers pretty quick.

      <h2>Assignment 2</h2>
      <p>
        For this assignment, the biggest challenge I faced was making the card layout responsive. For help with this, I turned to Stack Overflow, documentation, and blog posts for clarification on certain styling. In the end I was able to complete the assignment but the responsiveness is still not where I would like it to be. I already knew most of what was on this assignment but I did learn more a lot more about CSS grid.

        <h2>Assignment 3</h2>
        <p>
          The biggest challenge I faced while working on this assignment was figuring out how to create the search functionality for the assignment. I eventually got it all to work with the help of documentation, Youtube, and Stack Overflow. Through this assignment, I learned about the different ways that you can manipulate the DOM with Javascript and an interesting insight I learned was that Javascript allows you to do one task in A LOT of different ways. To complete this assignment I had to google the methods associated with arrays in Javascript and how to turn a NodeList into an array. I haven't touched Javascript in a while so this assignment was a much needed review for me.

          <h2>Assignment 4</h2>
          <p>
            This week, the biggest challenge I faced while working on this assignment was figuring out how the server deals with requests to a certain url and how to return files based on that url. To get over this challenge I utilized various posts on sites like Stack Overflow and geeksforgeeks, the lecture notes also proved to be very helpful in understaning the htttp module. This assignment taught me a lot about the back-end portion of a web application and it made me excited to learn more. To complete this assignment, I had to google the difference between res.setHeader() and res.writeHeader() and the difference between readFile() and readFileSync().
