    <p>
      Publishing the work was the biggest challenge I faced while working on this assignment but I was able to accomplish the task by going through the resources provided in the assigmnent instructions. I didn't have trouble with the actual assignment because I've worked with HTML in the past. The most helpful resource was Campuswire because it allowed me to post questions anonymously and receive answers pretty quick.
